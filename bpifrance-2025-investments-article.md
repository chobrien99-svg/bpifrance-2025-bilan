# The Numbers Behind France's Startup Machine: Bpifrance's 2025 Investment Report Card

**From seed to late-stage buyout, from green tech to defence, Bpifrance has more money moving in more directions than ever. But the venture data tells a more complicated story underneath the records.**

If you want to understand the health of the French startup ecosystem, one of the best places to start is Bpifrance's annual balance sheet — not the headline totals, but the granular investment data that traces where the public money actually flows, and where the gaps are widening. The 2025 activity report, presented last week by CEO Nicolas Dufourcq and deputy managing director Arnaud Caudoux, contained a lot for optimists to chew on. It also contained a few figures that should prompt some honest reflection.

## Growth Capital: Record Volumes, Record Returns

Start with the headline investment performance. Bpifrance's growth capital division deployed €2.5 billion in 168 companies. But the disposal figures were what really turned heads: €3.2 billion raised from selling stakes in 127 companies, generating €900 million in capital gains at an average multiple of eight times cost. "It's the first time we've had this level of added value on so many lines at the same time," said Caudoux. The deal list ranged from a €700 million ticket in Veolia to defence investments alongside Dassault in drones, pharmaceutical stakes in Opella and Biogaran, and anchoring Photonis — the night-vision optics maker — in France after it "almost went to the United States."

A quietly significant new thesis: Bpifrance is increasingly investing in what the private equity world calls tech LBOs — profitable or near-profitable digital companies graduating from venture into a more mature buyout model. "It was relatively unknown that BPI did it," Dufourcq acknowledged, "but now we reveal that it has become something fundamental for us and we are going to develop it." The strategy tracks the maturation of companies Bpifrance has backed for a decade: AI, cybersecurity, and software.

## The Fund-of-Funds: Countercyclical by Design, but Distribution Under Pressure

Bpifrance's fund-of-funds operation — 40 people managing €22 billion across 700 partner funds — illustrated both the strength and the stress of the French venture ecosystem. Bpifrance subscribed to €8 billion in new commitments across 77 funds, more than any prior year, deliberately countercyclical as market fundraising conditions tightened. The underlying portfolio covers 7,000 French companies, 600 more than in 2024.

The distributions picture was less cheerful. Partner funds returned €784 million to Bpifrance, down from €960 million. The reason is structural: Bpifrance commits 59% of its fund-of-funds capital to innovation and venture funds, but receives only 50% of distributions from that segment. Venture funds are struggling to exit. IPO windows are narrow, secondary markets slow, and the tech valuations that spiked in 2019–2021 are being gradually digested rather than crystallised. The DPI — distributions to paid-in capital, the key measure of how quickly funds return cash — is under pressure across the innovation end of the market.

## Deep Tech: Progress, but a Gaping Hole at the Top

The deep tech figures capture the most important long-term story. Bpifrance's deep tech plan, launched in 2019 with around 150 university spinouts per year, has steadily grown: 420 new deep tech startups were created in France in 2025, against an original target of 500. The bank directly invested €414 million in 90 deep tech startups, and total deep tech deployment across all instruments reached €5 billion.

The AI cohort was the most prominent. Direct equity of €240 million went into nine companies including Mistral, Poolside, and others Dufourcq describes as "really hardcore innovation." But here the data starts to flag a systemic problem. France is producing more deep tech startups than at any point in its history — Paris now ranks third globally in deep tech ecosystems — yet the late-stage capital to sustain them is conspicuously absent. Funds capable of writing €50 million to €100 million cheques into quantum computing, space tech, or frontier biotech companies are thin on the ground. "There is a real market flaw," Dufourcq said, "not only in France, but also in Europe." European savings continue to flow toward American rather than European risk. Knowing the diagnosis doesn't guarantee the cure.

## France 2030: A Deliberate Wind-Down, with Caveats

Innovation financing through France 2030 followed a steep downward trajectory. At its peak in 2023, the programme channelled €9.4 billion through Bpifrance. By 2024 that was €5 billion; in 2025, €3.4 billion, with stabilisation expected around €3 billion annually. The number of companies supported fell from 5,500 to 4,900. Subsidies and grants are declining; loans and convertible bonds grew 43%, and guarantee funds increasingly co-financed by Brussels are filling gaps.

Dufourcq is an unapologetic defender of the programme — "a miracle for the French innovation ecosystem" — and is lobbying for a France 2040 successor. But Parliament won't decide until after the 2027 elections. Meanwhile, the BPifrance Défense retail fund, launched in October, raised €53 million faster than any previous retail fund and has deployed into six companies, suggesting private appetite for alternative asset classes is growing. Whether that appetite expands to fill the space France 2030 is vacating at the innovation frontier is the defining question for the French startup ecosystem in 2026.

Underneath all the record-setting, the 2025 data reveals an ecosystem in genuine transition: early-stage funding robust, mid-market improving, late-stage thin, stimulus winding down. The challenge ahead is whether European private capital steps into the spaces that public money is beginning to vacate.
