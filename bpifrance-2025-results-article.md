# France's Innovation Bank Has a Record Year — But the Future Keeps It Up at Night

**BPifrance deployed €72 billion in 2025, broke records across the board, and bet big on artificial intelligence. So why does CEO Nicolas Dufourcq sound slightly nervous?**

Call it the paradox of the French state innovation bank. Bpifrance — the public institution that backs startups, guarantees loans for small businesses, and plunges billions into the kind of deep-tech bets that private investors prefer to avoid — just put up the best numbers in its 13-year history. And yet, standing before journalists at its annual press conference in Paris last week, CEO Nicolas Dufourcq couldn't quite suppress the worry lines.

The headline figures were impressive enough to make any banker blush with pride. In 2025, when you add up all of Bpifrance's activity — equity investments, guarantees, loans, innovation financing — the total comes to a staggering €72 billion, up sharply from €60 billion the previous year. Medium- and long-term credit crossed the €10 billion mark for the first time ever. Credit insurance hit €30 billion. The bank deployed €2.5 billion in growth capital across 168 companies, then sold €3.2 billion worth of stakes in 127 others, generating €900 million in capital gains at an average multiple of eight times cost. "It's been a very long time since we've had this level of added value," said deputy managing director Arnaud Caudoux. "It's the first time we've had this level of added value on so many lines at the same time."

## The AI Bet

If there's one theme that animated Bpifrance's 2025, it's artificial intelligence. At the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, Dufourcq announced a €10 billion multi-year plan to support the French AI ecosystem, from equity investments to door-to-door consulting for SMEs. By year-end, the results were already tangible: nearly €500 million deployed in direct investments and innovation financing for AI, including €240 million in equity poured into nine companies — Mistral (France's answer to OpenAI), Septéo, and the ambitious Campus IA infrastructure project.

Campus IA, to be built in Foujus in partnership with Abu Dhabi's MGX sovereign wealth fund, is billed as Europe's largest AI campus. Progress has been slower than the fanfare suggested — negotiations over land, building permits, and grid connections with RTE consumed most of 2025. "Most of the energy has been devoted to the creation of the company, to the negotiation with the elected officials and with the owners of plots," Dufourcq acknowledged. But permits are now in hand, and commitments from clients — including, intriguingly, American tech giants — are being finalised. When asked whether AI had shifted from deep tech into pure development capital, Dufourcq pushed back firmly. "When you put capital into Mistral, when you put capital into Poolside — all this is really hardcore innovation. These are deep tech startups."

## Deep Tech's Long Game

The AI surge sits within a broader deep tech story that Dufourcq tells with the patience of someone who measures progress in decades. Bpifrance launched its deep tech plan in 2019 with roughly 150 startups a year spinning out of French universities. In 2025, that figure reached 420, and Bpifrance deployed €5 billion across 1,000 deep tech startups in its portfolio. The original 2019 target was 500 new startups per year. "The bird is making its nest," Dufourcq said. Paris, he noted, now ranks third globally in deep tech ecosystems.

Success has exposed a new bottleneck: a shortage of large late-stage funds willing to write cheques of €50 million or more that maturing deep tech companies need to grow. "There is a real market flaw," Dufourcq said, "not only in France, but also in Europe." European pension funds, insurers, and family offices keep favouring American over European risk. "Private money in Europe" going to late-stage deep tech is "the 2026 battalion," he said — the problem everyone now understands but hasn't yet solved.

## Three Clouds on the Horizon

For all the record-breaking, the press conference was also a study in which problems Bpifrance can control and which it can't.

The ones it can't are painful. Three large stakes — in Stellantis, STMicro, and SoiTech — dragged the accounts significantly. Stellantis, once delivering €300 million a year in dividends, contributed only €140 million in 2025 and is heading to zero. Both chip companies posted sharply lower profits, and Bpifrance is required to consolidate its share of their results directly into its own books. Strip those three "lumps" out, and underlying operational performance was up €126 million on the year, yielding a net profit of €501 million. "We have three lines out of 1,200 that explain more than the drop in net income," said Caudoux.

The other headwind is structural. France 2030 — the government's innovation stimulus programme — is winding down from a peak of €9 billion annually to around €3.4 billion in 2025. Grants are shrinking; loans and convertible bonds are growing 43% to fill the gap. Dufourcq believes France 2030 "is a miracle for the French innovation ecosystem" and is fighting hard for a France 2040 successor. But Parliament won't decide until after the 2027 elections, and the political space looks tight. Parts of the left dislike the programme's current form; parts of the right think too much money went to startups. "We have 3 billion for 2026," Dufourcq said, which is "already not bad" — though said with the tone of a man who'd prefer considerably more.

And then there's China. Asked about French companies being undercut by Chinese competition, Dufourcq gave a careful answer: broad tariffs risk retaliation and ignore Europe's own deep dependencies on Chinese supply chains. What France and Europe really need, he argued, is a better-staffed trade directorate in Brussels, lower legal barriers for SMEs filing dumping complaints — currently an entry-ticket of €1 million in lawyer fees makes it a sport for big corporates only — and more surgical, product-specific measures. "Our problem is essentially a governance problem," he said. "We have the instruments."

## Solid Ground

None of this should obscure the fundamentals. Bpifrance's balance sheet stands at €106 billion. Its core equity tier-one capital ratio is 26%, well above regulatory minimums. The cost of risk on its €60 billion loan portfolio was just 34 basis points. Since 2013, the bank has returned €5.2 billion in dividends to its shareholders and €8 billion in taxes to the public purse, while growing its own equity by €9 billion. "We are the only European development bank," Caudoux noted, "that pays dividends like any private company and pays its corporate tax." Without those obligations, Bpifrance would have accumulated €16 billion in equity rather than nine.

The entrepreneurial culture it is trying to foster shows signs of real momentum: 20,000 business creators received interest-free loans, 900 companies enrolled in Bpifrance's accelerator schools, and 7,000 firms now hold Bpifrance capital indirectly through its fund-of-funds network. "The years go by more and more quickly," Dufourcq said, opening the presentation, "and they are richer and richer." For Bpifrance, 2025 was rich indeed. Whether 2026 can match it will depend on factors no development bank controls — including a European tech financing ecosystem still learning to bet on itself.
